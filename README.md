# Microcosm

Modeling a complex of quantum and biological-evolutionary randomness with double binding.

## Project components

* Non-deterministic random generator based on ADC noise.
* Spectrophotometry of changes in bioculture.
* Dependent biological culture matrix.

## Alghoritm

1. A random source generates coordinates to influence the biological environment.
2. After influence, the environment begins to change its topology and structure in the matrix.
3. By using a double bond, a non-random influence on the environment is exerted, with subsequent reading of the change.

*It is important to consider that a change in the environment may be inert.*
